The problem with the current ATO process is that it is: 

* **Confusing**: It’s complexity excludes non-technical people from fully understanding its problems. End users struggle to understand compliance and what is required to successfully and securely deliver a government IT system to production.
* **Misleading**: It doesn’t necessarily make systems more secure.
* **Reactive**: It’s a response to rules and regulations.
* **Manual**: A security plan can have 300 to 900 boxes to check, and the end product of the ATO process is a static document .
* **Labor intensive**: A security plan can be hundreds of pages.
* **Time-consuming**: It takes months/years to get an ATO.
* **Expensive**: Hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for just one ATO.
