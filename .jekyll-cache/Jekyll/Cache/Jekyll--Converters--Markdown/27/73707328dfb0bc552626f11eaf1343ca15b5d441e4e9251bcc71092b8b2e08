I"0<p>The problem with the current ATO process is that it’s:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Confusing: It’s complexity excludes non-technical people from fully understanding its problems. End users struggle to understand compliance and what is required to successfully and securely deliver a government IT system to production.</li>
  <li>Misleading: It doesn’t necessarily make systems more secure.</li>
  <li>Reactive: It’s a response to rules and regulations.</li>
  <li>Manual: A security plan can have 300 to 900 boxes to check, and the end product of the ATO process is a static document .</li>
  <li>Labor intensive: A security plan can be hundreds of pages.</li>
  <li>Time-consuming: It takes months/years to get an ATO.</li>
  <li>Expensive: Hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for just one ATO.</li>
</ul>
