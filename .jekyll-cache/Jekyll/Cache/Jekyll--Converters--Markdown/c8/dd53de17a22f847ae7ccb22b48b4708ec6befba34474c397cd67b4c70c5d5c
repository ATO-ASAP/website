I"§<p>The problem with the current ATO process is that itâ€™s:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Confusing</strong>: Itâ€™s complexity excludes non-technical people from fully understanding its problems. End users struggle to understand compliance and what is required to successfully and securely deliver a government IT system to production.</li>
  <li><strong>Misleading</strong>: It doesnâ€™t necessarily make systems more secure.</li>
  <li><strong>Reactive</strong>: Itâ€™s a response to rules and regulations.</li>
  <li><strong>Manual</strong>: A security plan can have 300 to 900 boxes to check, and the end product of the ATO process is a static document .</li>
  <li><strong>Labor intensive</strong>: A security plan can be hundreds of pages.</li>
  <li><strong>Time-consuming</strong>: It takes months/years to get an ATO.</li>
  <li><strong>Expensive</strong>: Hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars for just one ATO.</li>
</ul>
