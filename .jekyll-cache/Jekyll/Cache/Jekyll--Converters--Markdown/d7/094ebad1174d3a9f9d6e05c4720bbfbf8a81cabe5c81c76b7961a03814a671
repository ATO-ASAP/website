I"s<h2 id="our-goals">Our goals</h2>

<p>The ATO ASAP website is a work in progress, but as part of this we are attempting to follow the best practices we are documenting.</p>

<p>We strive to meet the latest W3C Recommendation of the WCAG guidelines (currently <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1 AA</a>).</p>

<h2 id="design-framework">Design framework</h2>

<p>The design framework for this website is built primarily leveraging the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/">U.S. Web Design System</a> which has undergone extensive accessibility testing. By leveraging open source best practices, we can benefit from much larger teams which have done extensive testing of their patterns.</p>

<h2 id="color">Color</h2>

<p>The website color palette is based on the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/color/system-tokens/">USWDS color tokens</a>.</p>

<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>

<p>The pages on this website are primarily written in Markdown which substantially reduces the range of errors available in HTML. These are then compiled using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and presented to the user as structured HTML5. The site is hosted on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, which has a very broad community of users who are free to to add issues or pull requests.</p>

  <li>We can control the accessibility of the site, but not the accessibility of GitHub. GitHub is reasonably accessible, but is not currently seeking to be as accessible as this site.</li>
