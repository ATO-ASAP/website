If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to ATO ASAP sponsored spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the ATO ASAP community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by ATO ASAP community members, especially bloggers, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the ATO ASAP community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside ATO ASAP spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the ATO ASAP community.</p>

<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. The ATO ASAP Anti-Abuse Team is not here to explain power differentials or other basic social justice concepts to you. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we‚Äôve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of ATO ASAP members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the ATO ASAP Anti-Abuse Team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all ATO ASAP spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other ATO ASAP members or the general public.</p>
